# General Approach
* This file describes the business rules that can be applied to data fields in ONE Record

## Precondititions
* Business rules are applied and documented in a revision-safe audit trail ^related to effected data field (see audit trail definition) 
* The business rules depend on a model of roles of stakeholders in the transportation process (see definition of roles and responsibilities)
  * Each stakeholder can have several roles
  * but ech stakeholder can perform a transaction applying only one role
